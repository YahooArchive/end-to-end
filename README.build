Repository for build-related tools for End-To-End.


Requirements:
============
This repository holds bash scripts and Grunt tasks that facilitate building
Google End-To-End. Building End-To-End should be fairly easy on any Linux/OSX system, however OS X users need to install JDK 1.7 from Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html). Windows build environment is not supported.

To build End-To-End, the following requirements must be met:
 - bash
 - git
 - curl
 - unzip
 - ant
 - JDK 1.7
 - Python

Usage
=====
Every task can be run from do.sh Bash script:

  $ ./do.sh
  Usage: ./do.sh {build_extension|build_library|build_templates|clean|check_deps|install_deps|testserver}

Setup
  $ git clone https://code.google.com/p/end-to-end.build/
  [...]
  $ cd end-to-end.build/
  $ ./do.sh install_deps
  Installing build dependencies...
  ...

Building the End-To-End extension
  $ ./do.sh build_extension
  All dependencies met.
  Building End-To-End extension to build/extension
  [...]
  $ ls build/extension/
  _locales    gmonkeystub.js    manifest.json   settings.html   welcome_binary.js
  glass.html    helper_binary.js  prompt.html   settings_binary.js  welcome_styles.css
  glass_binary.js   images      prompt_binary.js  settings_styles.css
  glass_styles.css  launcher_binary.js  prompt_styles.css welcome.html

Building the library only:
  $ ./do.sh build_library
  [...]
  $ ls build/library/
  end-to-end.compiled.js  end-to-end.debug.js

Building the soy templates:
  $ ./do.sh build_templates
  [...]
  $ ls build/templates/
  src

Starting the test server:
  $ ./do.sh testserver
  Starting the End-To-End test server (Press Ctrl-C to stop)...
  Starting test server at http://127.0.0.1:8000

Grunt
=====
For convenience, Gruntfile has been included to allow running the same tasks with Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/). Grunt andNode.js are not required to build End
-To-End though.
